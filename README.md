# Checkers
A [checkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkers) (draughts) game with a modern graphical user interface. The objective of checkers is to capture all opponent pieces before the player's time limit ends. The game features a PvP and a PvAI game mode while incorporating custom settings, player profiles, a rating system, and a help menu.


## GUI
The GUI of this program is meant to be simplistic and modern, featuring a flat look and feel with familiar and high-quality sound effects and images used for the checker pieces, board, and window icon, which is present in all windows. Additionally, the game window displays the two playing parties' profiles, containing their avatar, username, rating, and timer.

## Usage


### Settings
The user can choose between a native, dark, or light-themed GUI through the settings window. They can also enable audio feedback from the game. For the AI difficulty, the user can choose an intelligence level from 1 to 8. Moreover, the user can select the player time limit from a standard selection of 1 to 30 minutes. The user can also choose to play as black or red, with black playing first. When the user is done modifying the settings, they can hit apply to save the changes for future games or cancel to discard any modifications made.

### Game Input
The user can play the game using a mouse. If a piece is clicked on, its position on the board will be highlighted, and its legal moves will be displayed. At this stage, the user can either click on any displayed legal move to perform it, select an alternate piece, or reset their selection by clicking on the empty space on the game board. In addition to mouse input, the user can use the set shortcuts for the relevant menu items or the mnemonic of each menu to interact with the menu bar.

### Play
Users can play against other users in their local network (PvP) or against an AI (PvAI).

When the user hosts a PvP game, their opponent can join the game by entering the host's displayed IP address, and a new game with the host's game settings will commence. During this time, the two players also transfer their profile information via the local network.

In addition to PvP, the user can play against a [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) AI locally. The AI has a friendly profile with a rating corresponding to its difficulty level.
